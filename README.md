# Numerical methods implementations

This repository contains my solutions to various numerical problems using some known algorithms and numerical methods.

I heavily suggest using `vectalg.h` header file in almost every solution as it provides the ability to work on an abstract `Vector` structure. I've added it to this subfolder.

Majority of the algorithms used in these problems were concluded and coded with help of `David Kincaid, Ward Cheney - Numerical analysis - (numerical methods)` book. I highly recommend it from the bottom of my heart!

Every subfolder contains the task overview and decription in **Polish** (`X_treść.pdf` or `X_treść.png` file).
